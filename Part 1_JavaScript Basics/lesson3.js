// Lesson 3: WTF is NaN

// 1. WTF is an NaN
// NaN stands for "Not a Number"
// It basically is a numeric value that represent something
// that is ... not a number lmao XDDD

// Examples
// 0 / 0 is NaN
// 1 + NaN is defo NaN, because you can't do maths with something that's not a number

// 2. The typeof command 
// - To check the data type of something, we write typeof and then a space and then that
// thing in The Console

// Example (in The Console):
// > typeof 4 
// < "number"  (The Console is indicating that 4 is a Number)

// Funny enough, if you try to find out the data type of NaN, it will be a Number
// > typeof NaN
// < "number"
