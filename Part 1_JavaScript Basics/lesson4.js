// Part 1: JavaScript Basics!
// Lesson 4: Variables & Let

// 1. Variables
// They are like labels for values
// We can store a value and give it a name so that we can:
// - Refer back to it later
// - Use that value to do...stuff
// - Or change it later


// 2. Basic Syntax
// The syntax of registering a variable will follow this form: 
// let someName = value; 
// i.e: 
let year = 2003; 
// (Make me a variable called "year" and give it the value of 2003)

// 3. Recalling values
// We can play around with variables, like this:
let numberOfCars = 100; // assigning value 100 to numberOfCars
let numberOfBikes = 350; // assigning value 350 to numberOfBikes
let totalVehicles = numberOfCars + numberOfBikes; 
// This means the variable totalVehicles is calculated by taking the sum of 
// the two previous variables (numberOfCars and numberOfVehicles). Eventually, the 
// value that totalVehicles is holding, is 100 + 350 = 450
