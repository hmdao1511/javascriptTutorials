// Part 1: JavaScript Basics!
// Lesson 1 : How to approach JS, JavaScript Primitives and The Console

// 1. How to approach JS
// - First step: Learn JS on its own. So there won't be any HTML or CSS involved
// (I know it's boring, but we have to learn the basics of the JS language first,
// before applying it to something else)

// - Second step: After knowing the basics, use JS to manipulate HTML/CSS

// Good luck and have fun! :)

// 2. Primitive types
// The basic building blocks are:
// Number, String, Boolean, Null and Undefined.
// (Technically there are two other types (less commonly used): Symbol and BigInt)

// 3. The Console
// Open an Internet browser (Google Chrome), inspect a website and click onto the 
// "Console" section. This is where we should start writing some JS code as 
// a beginner. 

// It might look scary, but you don't have to worry about any of those (errors and stuff)

// To clear everything that is currently in the console, use the 
// function clear() and press Enter.

// You can play with your console in the browser (i.e: Doing mathematical calculations 

// by typing 1 + 1 and hit Enter. 2 will pop up). But as soon as you hit enter, the 
// code that you wrote will be gone :(
// That is why we will be working in files very soon, but for now let's stick to the 
// console.

// ----------
// Sum up (aka tl;dr)
// 1. Learn JS on its own first, and then use it for other uses

// 2. There are 5 main primitive types in JS: Number, String, Boolean, 
// Null and Undefined.

// 3. We can use the console in the browser to play with JS, and to clear everything
// in the console, use clear()
