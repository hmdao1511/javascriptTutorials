// Part 1: JavaScript Basics!
// Lesson 2: JavaScript Numbers

// 1. Numbers in JavaScript
// - JS has one number type only
// - That includes: Positive numbers, Negative numbers, Whole numbers (Integers)
// and decimal numbers 

// 2. Mathematical Operations 
// We have 5 main operations, which are: 

// - Addition: 50 + 5 = 55
// - Subtraction: 90 - 1 = 89
// - Multiplication: 11111 * 7 = 77777
// - Division: 400 / 25 = 16
// - Modulo! : 27 % 2 = 1 (aka The Remainder Operator)

// 3. Order of operations 
// This strictly follows the PEMDOS rule
// Parentheses -> Exponents -> Multiplication -> Division -> Addition -> Substraction

// Before you ask anything, exponents (exponential actions) are like something to the
// power of something (in mathematical notation it would be a^b)
// However, to use that ^ from maths notation in JS, we use ** (double asterisks)
// i.e: 2 ** 4 = 16
