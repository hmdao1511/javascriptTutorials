// Lesson 5: Updating Variables

// 1. Updating the variable
// Example: Let's say we are playing a game of rock, paper, scissors match
// We have a variable with the name "score" to keep track of the score we've won
// Each time a person wins a round, they get 5 points

// Firstly we define that variable score:
let score = 0;
// To update the score variable by adding 5 to it, we do the following:
score = score + 5; // It means that our variable score now stores the value 5
score = score + 5; // score now equals to 10

// We also have a shorthand for this kind of variable updating
score += 5; // score now equals to 15, this is something like maths accumulation 

// += exists, so as -= 
score -= 10; // score now has gone down to 5 
// Writing score -= 10 is the same as writing score = score - 10

// 2. Shorthand for updating variables
// x += 10 means x = x + 10
// x -= 10 means x = x - 10
// x *= 10 means x = x * 10
// x /= 10 means x = x / 10

// *Shorthand for incrementing/decrementing by 1
// x++ means x += 1 means x = x + 1
// x-- means x -= 1 means x = x - 1
