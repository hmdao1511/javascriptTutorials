// Part 2: JavaScript Strings and More
// Lesson 6: Undefined and Null in JavaScript

// 1. Wait...Are these primitive types too!? 
// Both Null and Undefined are all primitives, but they can be conufusing 
// at first

// - Null: 
//      + "Intentional absence of any value"
//      + Must be assigned 
//      + Note that Null is not a Boolean type in JavaScript!
//      + Think of Null as being undefined ON PURPOSE! (because Null is a value that 
// represents the intentional lack of value and this is something that we assign)

// - Undefined:
//      + Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined
//      + Think of Undefined as saying "I don't know! I don't know what you 
// want! I don't know what the value is!"


// 2. Null
// - We can make a variable and set it to null
// Example:
// No one is logged in yet...
let loggedInUser = null; // value is explicitly nothing

// Suddenly, a user logs in...
loggedInUser = "Hai Minh"

// 3. Undefined
// - It's just a concept that means something is not there/not being defined 
// - It doesn't mean nothingless, so it cannot be set as a value of something
