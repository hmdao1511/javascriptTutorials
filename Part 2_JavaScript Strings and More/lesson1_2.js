// Part 2: JavaScript Strings and More
// Lesson 1: Introducing Strings

// 1. What is a String?
// - String is a primitive type in JavaScript
// - They represent text, and must be wrapped in quotes 
// - String is basically textual information
// Example:
let username = "haiminh";

// Single quotes works with String too, but be consistent of what you use in 
// your codebase!
let surname = 'dao';

// Don't write like this, because it does not work:
// let middleName = "hai' 
// ERROR!

// Also, the numbers are diffent from numbers that are Strings!
// Example: 23 is different from "23"

// You can also have single quotes inside double quotes and vice versa
// Example: 
let whatIHaveSaid = "I said to her: 'I love you, Gnem!'";
let whatSheHasSaid = 'She said to me: "I love you too, Minh!"';
