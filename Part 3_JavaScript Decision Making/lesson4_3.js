// Part 3: JavaScript Decision Making
// Lesson 4: Running JavaScript from A Script!

// 1. How to run a JavaScript file
// - Step 1: Create a JavaScript file (.js)
// Note that the code is not gonna be evaluated immediately like in the 
// console, so we have to us console.log() to print something out
console.log("HELLO FROM OUR FIRST JS FILE!!!");

// - Step 2: Create an HTML file (.html) and  link this JavaScript file 
// to that HTML file by using the <script> tag with the "src" attribute 
// to indicate the location of your JavaScript file.
// Example: <script src="js/script.js"></script>  

// As for the convention of where to put that <script> tag in the HTML file, you
// should put it right before the ending tag of the <body> tag.

// - Step 3: Run that HTML file and open up the console and you will see the outcomes!
console.log("GOODBYE!")
